> A curated list of kesterite papers (since 2009)


We would like to provide *classic* kesterite papers which are worth reading. Rather than providing overwhelming amount of papers, we would like to provide a *curated list* of the awesome kesterite papers which are considered as *must-reads*.

## Overview

Initial list (2009-2014) are adopted from [Aron Walsh's blog](https://thelostelectron.wordpress.com/2015/05/28/beginners-guide-to-kesterite-czts-solar-cells/).

– X-ray diffraction has trouble distinguishing between Cu and Zn. Neutron diffraction confirms the ground-state crystal structure (not stannite) and the tendency for cation disorder.
